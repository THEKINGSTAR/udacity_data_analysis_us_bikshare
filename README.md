# ```Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree - US Bikeshare Project (2021)```

## ```Overview```

This project is part of the ```Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree``` and focuses on analyzing the US Bikeshare dataset. The primary goal is to showcase the ability to work with open datasets using Python, extract meaningful insights, and present them in a clear and interactive manner. The project emphasizes the use of ```shell-based``` ```Python scripts```, enabling users to interactively explore the data through ```command-line``` prompts.

## ```Project Details```

The ```US Bikeshare``` project uses data from the ```US Bikeshare system```, available on Kaggle. The data includes information about ```bike-sharing``` services in several ```US``` cities, such as ```Chicago```, ```New York City```, and ```Washington```. The analysis covers various aspects of the data, such as user demographics, trip durations, and popular stations, and provides insights through interactive prompts and ```shell-based``` colored text output.

### ```Key Features:```

- **Data Exploration**: The script allows users to filter the dataset based on city, month, and day of the week. It then calculates and displays key statistics like the most popular times of travel, stations, and trip durations.
  
- **Interactive Experience**: The project is designed to be run in a shell environment, where users can input their preferences for data filtering and receive real-time insights directly in the terminal.
  
- **Colored Text Output**: To enhance the user experience, the script generates color-coded text in the terminal, making it easier to differentiate between different types of information and insights.

## ```Getting Started```

### ```Prerequisites```

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use Python 3.x for compatibility with the provided script.

### ```Running the Project```

To execute the script and start exploring the US Bikeshare data, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Navigate** to the project directory.
3. **Run the script** using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash

   python3 bikeshare.py

   ```

### ```Additional Notes```

- The script will prompt you to select the city, month, and day of the week for which you want to analyze the data.
- After making your selections, the script will display various statistics, such as the most common travel times, most popular stations, and user demographics.
- The script is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring quick response times even with significant amounts of data.
